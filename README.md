If you like the project and want to support me on my sleepless nights, you can

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-prometheus-exporter', '~> 0.1'
```

And then execute:

```console
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```console
$ gem install sidekiq-prometheus-exporter -v '~> 0.1'
```

## Rack application

For a fresh new application to expose metrics create `config.ru` file with
next code inside

```ruby
require 'sidekiq'
require 'sidekiq/prometheus/exporter'

Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  config.redis = {url: 'redis://<your-redis-host>:6379/0'}
end

run Sidekiq::Prometheus::Exporter.to_app
```

Use your favorite server to start it up, like this

```console
$ bundle exec rackup -p9292 -o0.0.0.0
```

and then `curl https://0.0.0.0:9292/metrics`

## Rails application

When you have rails application, it's possible to mount exporter
as a rack application in your `routes.rb`

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # ... omitted ...

  # For more information please check here
  # https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/Mapper/Base.html#method-i-mount
  require 'sidekiq/prometheus/exporter'
  mount Sidekiq::Prometheus::Exporter => '/metrics'
end
```

Use rails server from `bin` folder to start it up, like this

```console
$ ./bin/rails s -p 9292 -b 0.0.0.0
```

and then `curl https://0.0.0.0:9292/metrics`

## Sidekiq Web (extream)

If you are ok with metrics being exposed via Sidekiq web dashboard because
you have it inside your private network or only Prometheus scraper will have access
to a machine/port/etc, then add a few lines into your web `config.ru`

```ruby
require 'sidekiq/web'
require 'sidekiq/prometheus/exporter'

Sidekiq::Web.register(Sidekiq::Prometheus::Exporter)
```

and then `curl https://<your-sidekiq-web-uri>/metrics`

## Docker

If we are talking about isolation you can run already prepared official
rack application in the Docker container by using the [public image](https://hub.docker.com/r/strech/sidekiq-prometheus-exporter)
(check out this [README](/blob/master/docker/README.md) for more)

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm \
             -p 9292:9292 \
             -e REDIS_URL=redis://<your-redis-host>:6379/0 \
             strech/sidekiq-prometheus-exporter
```

and then `curl https://0.0.0.0:9292/metrics`

## Helm

And finally the cloud solution _(who don't these days)_. Easy to install, easy
to use. A fully-functioning Helm-package based on official [Docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/strech/sidekiq-prometheus-exporter), comes with lots of [configuration
options](https://github.com/Strech/sidekiq-prometheus-exporter/blob/master/helm/sidekiq-prometheus-exporter/README.md)

```console
$ helm repo add strech https://strech.github.io/sidekiq-prometheus-exporter
"strech" has been added to your repositories

$ helm install strech/sidekiq-prometheus-exporter --name sidekiq-metrics
```

to `curl` your metrics, please follow the post-installation guide

# Tips&Tricks

If you want to see at the exporter startup time a banner about which exporters
are enabled add this call to your `config.ru` (but after exporter `configure` statement)

```ruby
require 'sidekiq/prometheus/exporter'

puts Sidekiq::Prometheus::Exporter.banner
```

:anger: if you don't see your banner try to output into `STDERR` instead of
`STDOUT`

## Sidekiq Contribs

By default we try to detect as many as possible [sidekiq contribs](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Related-Projects)
and add their metrics to the output.
But you can change this behaviour by configuring exporters setting

```ruby
require 'sidekiq/prometheus/exporter'

# Keep the default auto-detect behaviour
Sidekiq::Prometheus::Exporter.configure do |config|
  config.exporters = :auto_detect
end

# Keep only standard (by default) and cron metrics
Sidekiq::Prometheus::Exporter.configure do |config|
  config.exporters = %i(cron)
end
```

:bulb: if you did't find the contrib you would like to see, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/Strech/sidekiq-prometheus-exporter/issues/new) and describe what do you think we should export.
