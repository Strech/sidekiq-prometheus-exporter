                                                    being executed and current time.

# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-prometheus-exporter'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install sidekiq-prometheus-exporter -v '~> 0.1'
```

# Rack application

For  a fresh new application to expose metrics create `config.ru` file with
next code inside

```ruby
require 'sidekiq'
require 'sidekiq/prometheus/exporter'

Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  config.redis = {url: 'redis://<your-redis-host>:6379/0'}
end

run Sidekiq::Prometheus::Exporter.to_app
```

use your favorite server to start it up, like this

```
$ bundle exec rackup -p9292 -o0.0.0.0
```

and then `curl https://0.0.0.0:9292/metrics`

# Sidekiq Web (extream)

If you are fine, that metrics will be exposed via Sidekiq web dashboard because
you have it inside your private network or only Prometheus scraper will have an
access to a machine/port/etc, then add a few lines into your web `config.ru`

```ruby
require 'sidekiq/web'
require 'sidekiq/prometheus/exporter'

Sidekiq::Web.register(Sidekiq::Prometheus::Exporter)
```

and then `curl https://<your-sidekiq-web-uri>/metrics`
